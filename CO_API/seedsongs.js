    The difference in between
    All the faces you read
    When the grass ain't green
    When you fix everything
    
    [Pre-Chorus: Toro y Moi]
    I don't know about you
    But I got to get it out and I don't know how soon
    But if we die
    I want to bring the whole thing

    Who cares about a game
    When it's all been replaced?
    Each level feels the same
    It really goes either way

    I don't know about you

    Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto

    (When this began) I had nothing to say
    And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
    (I was confused) And I let it all out to find
    That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
    (Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
    Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
    (Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
    And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
    
    [Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel
    What I thought was never real
    I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
    Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel
    Like I'm close to something real
    I wanna find something I've wanted all along
    Somewhere I belong
    
    [Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
    And I've got nothing to say
    I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
    (I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
    That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
    (So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
    'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
    (Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
    And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
    
    [Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel
    What I thought was never real
    I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
    Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel
    Like I'm close to something real
    I wanna find something I've wanted all along
    Somewhere I belong
    
    [Bridge: Chester Bennington]
    I will never know myself until I do this on my own
    And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
    I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
    I will break away, I'll find myself today
    
    [Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel
    What I thought was never real
    I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
    Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
    I wanna heal, I wanna feel

    I wanna find something I've wanted all along

    Open up your plans and, damn, you're free

    I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    But my breath fogged up the glass
    And so I drew a new face and I laughed
    I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
    To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
    It's what we aim to do
    Our name is our virtue

    Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
    And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
    The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
    So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
    There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
    'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
    This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)

    Hello, it's me
    I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
    To go over everything
    They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
    Hello, can you hear me?
    I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
    When we were younger and free
    I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

    There's such a difference between us
    And a million miles

    Hello from the other side
    I must've called a thousand times
    To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
    But when I call, you never seem to be home
    Hello from the outside
    At least, I can say that I've tried
    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
    But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
    
    [Verse 2]
    Hello, how are you?
    It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
    I hope that you're well
    Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

    It's no secret that the both of us
    Are running out of time
